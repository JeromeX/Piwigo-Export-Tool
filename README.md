## 📖 About
This PowerShell tool provides a modern, dark-themed GUI to export your entire Piwigo gallery directly from your server. Unlike simple FTP downloads, this tool connects to your Piwigo MySQL database to understand the logical album structure and reconstructs it locally on your PC.

It solves common issues like "flat" file structures in the `upload` folder and broken character encodings (e.g., German umlauts).

## ✨ Features

* **🖥️ Modern GUI:** A clean, resizeable WPF interface with a dark theme and neon accents.
* **🔐 Secure Connection:** Full SSH and SCP integration. Supports `id_rsa` keys and password authentication.
* **📂 Structure Reconstruction:** Reads the MySQL/MariaDB database to recreate your exact album hierarchy locally.
* **🛠️ Smart Encoding Fix:** Automatically repairs broken filenames and album names (e.g., fixes `Ã¤` to `ä`, `Zõhler` to `Zähler`).
* **⚡ Incremental Backup:** Checks for existing files to skip duplicates (configurable).
* **📦 ZIP Archiving:** Optional feature to zip every exported album automatically.
* **📜 Integrated Logging:** Built-in SQLite log viewer to track every transfer.
* **📜 Integrated Logging:** Databases (logs and credentials) are encrypted for your security
* **🌍 Multi-Language:** Live switching between English 🇺🇸 and German 🇩🇪.

## 🚀 Prerequisites

* **OS:** Windows 10 or Windows 11.
* **SSH:** OpenSSH Client (enabled by default on Windows).
* **Admin:** Administrator / Root access is needed
* **.NET 8.0 SDK (v8.0.416)** needed --> https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-8.0.416-windows-x64-installer
